<p>

The apartment has cameras in areas inside the apartment where privacy is expected.
<p>
Two of cameras were this:
<p>
<a href="http://us.dlink.com/products/cameras/mini-hd-wi-fi-camera-dcs-8000lh/">D-Link DCS-8000LH</a>
<p>
Which support sound and motion triggered recording to cloud and forwarding by email etc. as well as any time remote Viewing from any iPhone, iPad or Android etc.<br>
They also support night vision.
<p>
The cameras were found in the children play room, and over the lounge area. Both cameras were activated and connected to the WiFi network (see attached IP scan of WiFi network).<br>
The camera in children playroom was placed amongst other items on shelf, making it not readily apparent. The red LED on camera was taped over, reducing camera's visibility.<br>
The camera pointing it the lounge area was somewhat hidden next to speaker and painted in wall color, reducing its visibility. The red LED on camera was painted over, reducing camera's visibilty.<br>
<p>
Those are the cameras that we found. There may be others.
<p>
When we disconnected the apartments WiFi to stop any IP camera's ability to transmit images from inside our apartment to outside viewers
we were contacted in the matter of few hours (by SMS) by the host, who advised that they were aware the Internet connectivity was not working and asking us to re-set the internet router.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, we were approached by somebody the next morning, with that person communicating to us though the apartments front door (which we did not open) requesting that we re-set the internet router.
<p>
The person who communicated with us through the closed door is staying in the building, and we were advised they are a family relative of host, 
making it possible that they are in possession of the code needed to open the front door of the apartment in which we are staying.
<p>
The request was made again by host a few days later. 
<p>
The above events made us feel uncomfortable in our stay, with our children aware of what is happening and obviously affected.<br>
The only reason we did not leave immediately is that it is very difficult to find suitable alternative accommodation in nearby area, 
effectively trapping us in a situation where we need to constantly question our security.
<p>
I attach photographs from inside the apartment showing the location of the above two cameras.
